            <p>It has been part of the human experience throughout time and throughout all cultures. To be human, is in itself an art, as seen through the creative problem solving everyone uses to survive. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Art can also be so specific and specialized that we’re not even sure sometimes, if anybody making any new art. It can be such a mystery that no matter what time period you were to have lived in, there was always somebody saying that it’s all been done before.</p>
            <p>I work to contribute somewhere in the middle of this spectrum, with a nod to what has been built upon in the past and a sense of the universal.</p>

            <p>The physical manifestation of an object is essential to the concept of art. The thing we were able to experience with our senses, became a way for us to declare something more beautiful than another, and call it art. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea to originally call something art was in itself a concept and many great things have been made with knowledge that meaning and history of an action contribute to the finished work. There have even been a few artists that have made artwork without a form, although this usually only works because the concept of the form is so strong.</p>
            <p>My work is a blend of technique and a concept thought out over time.</p>

            <p>Europe is where western art can be said to have begun, and even though the whole story is a bit suspect since they only ever talk about dudes making it, there have been some inspirational movements to come from there throughout time. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; America is where western art can said to have continued and even though the current world is being pushed this ‘dream culture’ in not so refined ways, there have been some fresh ideas to come out of this diverse place.</p>
            <p>My experience in Europe and America has given me a broad understanding of western art.</p>

            <p>Maybe, since the first museum opened, we have been putting art into a logical timeline that progress’s from one period to the next. At one point we declared it to be Modern and at another point we declared it to Contemporary. &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, now that we have access to view practically all the art that was ever made and documented, it is a bit harder to tell where this western art timeline is going in the future. I think we can draw the line at Post-Post Contemporary.</p>
            <p>Learning about the history of western art has inspired and propelled me, but I keep myself open and try not to assume to know where it is going.</p>
